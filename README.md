👋 Hi, I’m @FearghalM!

👀 I have experience in Python programming, particularly in the context of Raspberry Pi projects. I've worked with Arduino sensors to connect hardware and capture sensor data. Additionally, I've implemented face recognition via the Raspberry Pi camera and integrated it with AWS for identity verification and access control.

🌱 I’m currently focused on learning Python scripting for automation and data analysis.

💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on Python projects involving automation, data processing, and innovative hardware integrations.

⚡ Fun fact: I have a Lurcher named Harvey. He has a unique pair of heterochromatic eyes — each one is half blue and half brown!
